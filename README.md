# Notebooks on Maths

Repository of [jupyter] notebooks about math/physics problems discussed with good friends and (in the best case) even with  solutions!

- Every folder is a different problem and normally contain:
  - One or more [jupyter] notebook with code (typically in [python3x]) and discussion notes, calculations, etc
  - A ``README.md`` with a badge (I love badges!) to [mybinder]: an easy way have everythin ready running w/o installing anything and easy to share while discussing
- ``Makefile`` is mostly for local development
