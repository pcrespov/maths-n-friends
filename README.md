# Math & Friends

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pcrespov/maths-n-friends.git/latest)

Repository of [jupyter] notebooks created around small math & physics problems discussed with good friends and (in the best case) even with  solutions!

- Every folder is a different problem and normally contain one or more [jupyter] notebook with code (typically in [python3x]) and discussion notes, calculations, etc
- If you want to run them on your own machine (Linux/Mac)

```cmd
  git clone https://github.com/pcrespov/maths-n-friends.git
  make devenv 
  make start
```
- If you want to run them online, just client [mybinder] badge above (I love badges BTW!)
