# Notebooks on Maths

Repository of [jupyter] notebooks about math/physics problems discussed with good friends and (in the best case) even with  solutions!

Every folder is a different problem and normally contain:
    - One or more [jupyter] notebook for discussion notes and calculations
    - A ``README.md`` with a badge (I love badges!) to [mybinder]: an easy way have everythin ready running w/o installing anything and easy to share while discussing
